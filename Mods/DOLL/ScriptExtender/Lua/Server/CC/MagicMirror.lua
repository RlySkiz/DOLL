-- Magic Mirror doesn't work when an entity has more visuals than allowed
-- ex: a human has a tail

-- when the user interacts with the magic mirror, save the visuals
-- then remove all extra visuals (ex: keep hair, or wings for aasimar)

-- then on exiting the MagicMirror present them with their previous visuals
-- and ask them which ones they want to keep
